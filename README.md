# Linear-Regression-IndianJobMarket

**Introduction:** This project is a Linear Regression analysis to predict salary based on various features, such as gender, education percentages, personality traits, and skills. The goal is to find the best-performing model.

## Data Preparation

### Reading Data
- Data is loaded using the Pandas library.

### Feature Selection
- An initial model is trained using selected features.

### Model Evaluation
- The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Personality Features

### Model Selection
- Models are built using personality features.
- Cross-validation is used to evaluate the models.
- The best-performing personality feature is determined.

### Best Personality Feature Model
- A model with the best personality feature is trained and evaluated.

## Skill Features

### Model Selection
- Models are built using skill features.
- Cross-validation is used to evaluate the models.
- The best-performing skill feature is determined.

### Best Skill Feature Model
- A model with the best skill feature is trained and evaluated.

## Custom Multi-feature Model

### Model Selection
- Multiple feature sets are tested.
- Cross-validation is used to evaluate the models.
- The best multi-feature model is determined.

### Final Model
- A custom multi-feature model is trained using the selected features.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of feature selection and cross-validation in building accurate predictive models for salary. Various feature sets and feature types are explored to identify the best-performing model.
